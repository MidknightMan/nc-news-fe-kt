Welcome to the front-end of NC-News ('In The Know'). This provides a user interface to the back-end NC-News created (link below)in order to view, vote and comment on articles as well as adding your own. Topics can be selected from the navigation bar to filter content and all returned articles in the article list can be sorted by a variety of criteria in ascending or descending fashion. The 'My Profile' page will display your user information (currently, this is just your username and picture however further functionality may be added). Voting on articles and comments can only occur up or down once in either direction however there is the ability for you to change your mind should you need to.

In order to access all features, the password for the user login is 'admin'. All users have this password. The usernames accepted are:
